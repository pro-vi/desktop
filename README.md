# Agentify Desktop

Agentify Desktop is a local-first control center for AI work: connect your real, logged-in AI subscriptions to your MCP-compatible CLI tools, all on your own machine.

### Why teams keep it open
- `🌐` **Real browser sessions, real accounts**: automate the web UIs you already use, without API-key migration.
- `🔌` **MCP-native integration**: works with Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and other MCP-capable clients.
- `🧵` **Parallel tabs for parallel work**: run multiple isolated workflows at once using stable tab keys.
- `📎` **Practical I/O support**: upload files and download generated images from assistant responses.

## Supported sites
**Supported**
- `chatgpt.com`
- `perplexity.ai`
- `claude.ai`
- `aistudio.google.com`
- `gemini.google.com`
- `grok.com`

**Planned**
- Additional vendor profiles via `vendors.json` + selector overrides.

## CAPTCHA policy (human-in-the-loop)
Agentify Desktop does **not** attempt to bypass CAPTCHAs or use third-party solvers. If a human verification appears, the app pauses automation, brings the relevant window to the front, and waits for you to complete the check manually.

## Requirements
- Node.js 20+ (22 recommended)
- MCP-capable CLI (optional, for MCP): Codex, Claude Code, or OpenCode

## Quickstart (macOS/Linux)
Quickstart installs dependencies, auto-registers the MCP server for installed clients (Codex/Claude Code/OpenCode), and starts Agentify Desktop:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:agentify-sh/desktop.git
cd desktop
./scripts/quickstart.sh
```

Debug-friendly: show newly-created tab windows by default:
```bash
./scripts/quickstart.sh --show-tabs
```

Foreground mode (logs to your terminal, Ctrl+C to stop):
```bash
./scripts/quickstart.sh --foreground
```

Choose MCP registration target explicitly:
```bash
./scripts/quickstart.sh --client auto     # default
./scripts/quickstart.sh --client codex
./scripts/quickstart.sh --client claude
./scripts/quickstart.sh --client opencode
./scripts/quickstart.sh --client all
./scripts/quickstart.sh --client none
```

## Manual install & run
```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

The Agentify Control Center opens. Use it to:
- Show/hide tabs (each tab is a separate window)
- Create tabs for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Studio, Gemini, and Grok
- Tune automation safety limits (governor)

Sign in to your target vendor in the tab window.

If your account uses SSO (Google/Microsoft/Apple), keep **Settings → Allow auth popups** enabled in the Control Center. ChatGPT login often opens provider auth in a popup, and blocking popups can prevent login from completing.

## Browser backend choice
Agentify Desktop now supports two browser backends:

- `electron` (default): embedded windows managed directly by Agentify.
- `chrome-cdp`: launches/attaches a real Chrome-family browser via the Chrome DevTools Protocol.

If Google/Microsoft/Apple SSO is fighting Electron, switch to **Settings → Browser backend → Chrome CDP**, save, then restart Agentify Desktop.

`chrome-cdp` notes:
- Uses a managed browser profile at `~/.agentify-desktop/chrome-user-data/`
- Default remote debugging port is `9222`
- Prefers your local Chrome install, but also works with Chromium / Brave / Edge
- Uses real browser login flows, which is the main reason to choose it

Profile options in the Control Center:
- `Agentify isolated profile` (default): safest and most predictable
- `Existing Chrome profile`: reuses your normal Chrome session/profile

If you choose `Existing Chrome profile`, fully quit regular Chrome first, then start Agentify Desktop. If Chrome is already using that profile, Agentify will fail fast with a hint instead of attaching to the wrong browser state.

## First Useful Workflow
This is the simplest real workflow to prove the product is doing something useful.

1. Start Agentify Desktop:
```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

2. In the Control Center:
- set `Browser backend` to `Chrome CDP`
- keep `Chrome profile mode` as `Agentify isolated profile`
- click `Save`
- restart Agentify Desktop if you changed the backend

3. Click `Show default`, then sign in to ChatGPT in the browser window.

4. Register the MCP server in your CLI.

Codex:
```bash
codex mcp add agentify-desktop -- node /ABS/PATH/TO/desktop/mcp-server.mjs
```

Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio agentify-desktop -- node /ABS/PATH/TO/desktop/mcp-server.mjs
```

5. In your MCP client, run this exact workflow:

Prompt:
```text
Create or reuse an Agentify tab with key repo-triage.
Use ChatGPT to answer this:
"Summarize the architecture of this repo in 8 bullets, then list the top 3 risky areas to change first."
Return the answer and keep the tab key stable for follow-ups.
```

6. Follow up in the same tab:

Prompt:
```text
Use the existing Agentify tab key repo-triage.
Ask for a test plan for changing one of those risky areas.
Return the plan as a short checklist.
```

That proves the core loop:
- keep a persistent logged-in web session
- call it from Codex / Claude Code over MCP
- reuse the same tab/session across multiple requests

Good next workflow:
- create separate keys like `cmp-chatgpt`, `cmp-claude`, `cmp-gemini`
- send the same architecture prompt to each
- compare answers before making changes

Optional overrides:
```bash
AGENTIFY_DESKTOP_BROWSER_BACKEND=chrome-cdp npm run start
AGENTIFY_DESKTOP_CHROME_DEBUG_PORT=9333 npm run start
AGENTIFY_DESKTOP_CHROME_BIN="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" npm run start
```

Equivalent CLI flags:
```bash
npm run start -- --browser-backend chrome-cdp
npm run start -- --chrome-debug-port 9333
npm run start -- --chrome-binary "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
```

## Connect from MCP clients
Quickstart can register MCP automatically, but manual commands are below if you prefer explicit setup.

### Codex
From the repo root:
```bash
codex mcp add agentify-desktop -- node mcp-server.mjs [--show-tabs]
```

From anywhere (absolute path):
```bash
codex mcp add agentify-desktop -- node /ABS/PATH/TO/desktop/mcp-server.mjs [--show-tabs]
```

Confirm registration:
```bash
codex mcp list
```

### Claude Code
From the repo root:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio agentify-desktop -- node mcp-server.mjs [--show-tabs]
```

From anywhere (absolute path):
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio agentify-desktop -- node /ABS/PATH/TO/desktop/mcp-server.mjs [--show-tabs]
```

Confirm registration:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

### OpenCode
OpenCode can be configured in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "agentify-desktop": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["node", "/ABS/PATH/TO/desktop/mcp-server.mjs"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

`./scripts/quickstart.sh --client opencode` (or `--client all`) writes/updates this entry automatically.

Confirm registration:
```bash
opencode mcp list
```

If you already had your client open, restart it (or start a new session) so it reloads MCP server config.

## Developer workflows (natural language)
Use plain requests in your MCP client. You usually do not need to call tool IDs directly.

1. **Plan in ChatGPT Pro or Gemini Deep Think, then execute in phases.**
Prompt:
"Open a Gemini tab with key `plan-auth-v2`, ask Deep Think for a migration plan from session cookies to JWT in this repo, and return a 10-step checklist with risk and rollback per step."
Follow-up:
"Now use key `plan-auth-v2` and generate step 1 implementation only, including tests."

2. **Prompt all vendors and compare output quality before coding.**
Prompt:
"Create tabs for keys `cmp-chatgpt`, `cmp-claude`, `cmp-gemini`, and `cmp-perplexity`. Send the same architecture prompt to each. Then compare responses in a table by correctness, operational risk, implementation complexity, and testability."

3. **Run incident triage with attached evidence.**
Prompt:
"Open key `incident-prod-api`, send `./incident/error.log` and `./incident/dashboard.png`, and produce: likely root cause, 30-minute hotfix plan, rollback, and validation checklist."

Use explicit tool calls (`agentify_query`, `agentify_read_page`, etc.) when you need deterministic/reproducible runs or when debugging tool selection.

## How to use (practical)
- **Use ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude/AI Studio/Gemini/Grok normally (manual):** write a plan/spec in the UI, then in your MCP client call `agentify_read_page` to pull the transcript into your workflow.
- **Drive ChatGPT/Perplexity/Claude/AI Studio/Gemini/Grok from your MCP client:** call `agentify_ensure_ready`, then `agentify_query` with a `prompt`. Use a stable `key` per project to keep parallel jobs isolated.
- **Parallel jobs:** create/ensure a tab per project with `agentify_tab_create(key: ...)`, then use that `key` for `agentify_query`, `agentify_read_page`, and `agentify_download_images`.
- **Upload files:** pass local paths via `attachments` to `agentify_query` (best-effort; depends on the site UI).
- **Generate/download images:** ask for images via `agentify_query` (then call `agentify_download_images`), or use `agentify_image_gen` (prompt + download).

## Real-world prompt example
Example `agentify_query` input:
```json
{
  "key": "incident-triage-prod-api",
  "prompt": "You are my senior incident engineer. I attached a production error log and a screenshot from our monitoring dashboard.\\n\\nGoal: produce a high-confidence triage summary and a safe hotfix plan I can execute in 30 minutes.\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1) Identify the most likely root cause with evidence from the log lines.\\n2) List top 3 hypotheses and how to falsify each quickly.\\n3) Give a step-by-step hotfix plan with exact commands.\\n4) Include rollback steps and post-fix validation checks.\\n5) Keep response concise and actionable.\\n\\nReturn format:\\n- Root cause\\n- Evidence\\n- 30-minute hotfix plan\\n- Rollback\\n- Validation checklist",
  "attachments": [
    "./incident/error.log",
    "./incident/dashboard.png"
  ],
  "timeoutMs": 600000
}
```

## What's new
- First-class multi-vendor tab support now includes Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Studio, Gemini, and Grok.
- Control Center reliability and UX were hardened (state/refresh wiring, tab actions, compact controls, clearer field guidance).
- Local API hardening includes strict invalid JSON handling, key/vendor mismatch protection, and safer tab-key recovery.
- Desktop runtime hardening includes Control Center sandboxing plus dependency security updates.

## Governor (anti-spam)
Agentify Desktop includes a built-in governor to reduce accidental high-rate automation:
- Limits concurrent in-flight queries
- Limits queries per minute (token bucket)
- Enforces minimum gaps between queries (per tab + globally)

You can adjust these limits in the Control Center after acknowledging the disclaimer.

## Not Supported Right Now
The experimental orchestrator / single-chat emulator is intentionally hidden from the desktop UI and is not supported right now.
The supported product surface is the local browser-control + MCP workflow described above.

## Limitations / robustness notes
- **File upload selectors:** `input[type=file]` selection is best-effort; if ChatGPT changes the upload flow, update `selectors.json` or `~/.agentify-desktop/selectors.override.json`.
- **Perplexity selectors:** Perplexity support is best-effort and may require selector overrides in `~/.agentify-desktop/selectors.override.json` if UI changes.
- **Gemini selectors:** Gemini support is best-effort and may require selector overrides in `~/.agentify-desktop/selectors.override.json` if UI changes.
- **Completion detection:** waiting for “stop generating” to disappear + text stability works well, but can mis-detect on very long outputs or intermittent streaming pauses.
- **Image downloads:** prefers `<img>` elements in the latest assistant message; some UI modes may render images via nonstandard elements.
- **Parallelism model:** “tabs” are separate windows; they can run in parallel without stealing focus unless a human check is required.
- **Security knobs:** default is loopback-only + bearer token; token rotation and shutdown are supported via MCP tools.

## Login troubleshooting (Google SSO)
- Symptom: login shows “This browser or app may not be secure” or the flow never completes.
- Check 1: In Control Center, enable `Allow auth popups (needed for Google/Microsoft/Apple SSO)`.
- Check 2: Retry login from a fresh ChatGPT tab (`Create tab` → `ChatGPT` → `Show`).
- Check 3: If your provider asks for WebAuthn/security key prompts, complete/cancel once and continue; some providers require that step before password/passkey fallback.
- Check 4: Switch to the `chrome-cdp` backend and restart. This uses a real Chrome-family browser and avoids the embedded Electron auth path entirely.

## Build installers (unsigned)
```bash
npm run dist
```
Artifacts land in `dist/`.

## Security and data
- Control API binds to `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port by default.
- Auth uses a local bearer token stored under `~/.agentify-desktop/`.
- Electron session data (cookies/local storage) is stored under `~/.agentify-desktop/electron-user-data/`.

See `SECURITY.md`.

## Trademarks
Forks/derivatives may not use Agentify branding. See `TRADEMARKS.md`.
